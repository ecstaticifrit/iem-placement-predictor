At first, I used K-Means to cluster the students based on the features. Based on that, the dataset alongwith the predictions was fit into a SVM. The dataset was provided by IEM Placement Cell in a public group without our permissions. It's not like we have any right to keep our personal information confidential or anything. I mean, who wouldn't want their address, phone number, and parents' details readily available for all the creeps and scammers out there?
